First, if you wanna fuck anyone else type /set and click the button that says enable under auto decline (see https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1073998891789328525/1073998930993496064/image.png)
Then read the instructions board that you spawn in front of ingame, that has all the chat commands to do whatever.
To use /rm or /b, you need to use /g first
